Grappl is a tool for hosting servers behind closed ports. Other people don't have to download anything to connect.

It works by transferring data through a proxy on grappl.io.

It's still in an alpha state. This repository contains all the newest client code, and some of the server and web code.

This project uses the [Gson](https://github.com/google/gson) library. Remember to set it up on your IDE.
